If you’ve ever wondered about the relationship between Beefy and Moonpot, it’s time to set the record straight. The ties between the projects run deep, and the technology that powers them shares a lot of similarities. Much of the Moonpot team even works on Beefy too. But what does that officially mean? Let’s take a deeper look at the points above and get to the bottom of the Beefy Moonpot connection.

### Are Beefy and Moonpot technically related?

If you’re not familiar with Moonpot, let’s briefly dive into how it works. When you deposit crypto into a Moonpot, you earn compounded interest on your assets. Half of this interest goes to you, and the other half goes to the prize pool. You also receive tickets proportional to your deposit for a chance to win in the regular prize draw.

The underlying technology that powers this system is the mighty Beefy Vault. When you deposit in Moonpot, your crypto is sent to one of our vaults to generate interest. Moonpot, therefore, acts as a layer on top of Beefy that redistributes the rewards according to its game.

### Do Beefy and Moonpot have the same team?

If you spend any time in the Beefy and Moonpot Discord or Telegram channels, you might notice a few familiar faces. Many of the Moonpot devs also work on Beefy, along with some of Moonpot’s marketing and UX department. Note that while the teams share members, they are not the same team. The way these projects are run differs, and neither Beefy nor Moonpot can tell the other what to do.

### Does Beefy own Moonpot?

In a nutshell, no. Beefy and Moonpot are two separate projects. While some of the people, technology, and resources are the same, they still have independence. While Beefy did provide some initial funding to Moonpot, it has since been recouped in $POTS tokens. Through its treasury, Beefy offers funding to interesting and promising projects, and Moonpot is a shining example.

### The Beefy Cow and Ziggy Moonpot are quite the duo

The best way to describe Beefy and Moonpot’s relationship is as a partnership. There are many similarities and a great deal of cooperation. Much of the security and earning potential of Moonpot is derived from Beefy services. And as you all know, Beefy offers a hell of a service.

So while Moonpot does work with new smart contracts, the vast majority have been developed by the Beefy team you know and love. Moonpot even has a Certik audit you can check out [here](https://www.certik.com/projects/moonpot).
