Crypto.com launched their own blockchain, Cronos, and Beefy deploys there to offer the most safe and reliable auto-compounding users know of.

Another giant joins the DeFi space, and they are doing it big. In less than 5 days Cronos locked more than 500M TVL on their chain, and the number seems to only go up. There might be many reasons for this success, could be the extremely nice APYs their main AMM offers (VVS), could be that it is seamlessly integrated with Crypto.com, or could be that people trust in the endorsement Crypto.com offersâ€¦ or it could be all of those!

### About Cronos

Cronos is the first Cosmos EVM chain for DeFi, NFTs and Metaverse. It aims to massively scale the DeFi and decentralized application ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to instantly port apps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. With low cost, high throughput, fast finality, and built-in interoperability, Cronos is poised to bring decentralized applications to the 10M+ user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem and beyond.

### Beefy Vaults

The cow never sleeps, this is why our team has been looking at VVS smart contracts, to create the vaults that auto-compound VVS rewards into more of the token you deposited.  
Did you see these amazing opportunities?

### How to reach Cronos

This might not come as a surprise. The best way to get money into Cronos (and into these vaults) is through Crypto.com. All you need to do is have your tokens on your Crypto.com account, and withdraw to an external wallet. The process is super straight-forward and if you run into any trouble, you can head over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DRw3wCdP). Under the #cronos channel you will find a pinned message with a Step by Step tutorial guiding you through the whole process. In that channel you will also find other decentralized alternatives, like [Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/bridge) or [Elk](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router).

There's also a [bridging walkthrough guide](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/bridge/cdcapp.html) on Cronos documentation page. Have in mind that you will need a KYC account to take this approach.

Remember that the best way to bridge the $BIFI token is through Anyswap.
