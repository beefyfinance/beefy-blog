Another day, another network. 12 to be precise. The Beefy Cow has some brand new pastures to graze on and Vaults to explore in the Metis ecosystem. Not familiar with the network? Metis is, in fact, less than two months old, and Beefy Finance isn’t the kind of DAO that likes to miss out on new opportunities. Let’s take a closer look at what Metis does and how Beefy has partnered with the new chain.

### About Metis

Metis is a new layer-2 rollup that aims to build a hub for the Web3 economy by providing

1. A layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution to allow fast, cheap transactions
2. Blockchain middleware with smart contract templates
3. A Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) infrastructure to build decentralized businesses on-chain. These should have all the functionality of real-world enterprises with the decentralization experienced with blockchains.

For more information on the project, why not dive into the Metis community? Drop by for a chat on Metis' [Telegram](http://t.me/MetisDAO), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/MetisDAO), or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RqfEJZXnxd). You can also read all their latest announcements on [Medium](http://metisdao.medium.com).

> "_We are delighted to partner with Beefy Finance to help accelerate the growth of our already booming ecosystem. Beefy Finance will significantly strengthen our already strong stable of DeFi offerings, and Beefy's multi-chain approach fits perfectly with Metis' mission of creating a hub for the entire Web3 economy, interconnected with the rest of the vast blockchain world_." — Elena Sinelnikova, Metis Co-Founder and CEO

### Metis’ key features

With Metis’ mainnet still less than two months old, staking your coins in a Metis vault can be a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Within its short life, Metis already has:

1. Bridges to 5 major networks with more coming soon
2. Multiple oracle providers
3. An NFT Marketplace available via MetaCraft.pro
4. Three DEXs, Netswap, Tethys.Finance, and Standard.Protocol, with the largest (Netswap) hitting $100M TVL three works after its launch. Netswap will also have its own launchpad at the end of January with preferred access given to $NETT and $METIS token holders.
5. A $1M hackathon completed with dozens of DApps to be integrated

### Metis deployed Vaults

Beefy has launched 11 Netswap Vaults on Metis with more to be added in the future. To start autocompounding and maximizing your Metis gains, just drop your LP tokens into a Vault on [Beefy Finance DApp](http://beefy.finance) or Zap in with a single asset. You can keep up to date with developments by following @beefyfinance on Twitter.

### Closing words

The blockchains are coming thick and fast, and adding Metis to the Beefy roster is great for the Cowmoonity and $BIFI holders. If you want to get your hands on some $METIS or $NETT to stake, head to Uniswap or SushiSwap to trade for the tokens from their available liquidity pools. Happy staking!
