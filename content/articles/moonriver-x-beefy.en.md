The lunar tidal influence on rivers is undeniable. While the effect might not be the same on cows, they are at least gathering to drink from these news sources of DeFi water!.

Beefy Finance truly believes in the multi-chain future with Moonriver becoming the 9th chain we deploy on. In this blog, we will learn a bit about the Moonriver parachain, how you can reach it, and the vaults we have deployed. Let’s get started!

### About Moonriver

Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama network that launched in June 2021. It is a sister network of Moonbeam and provides an environment to test incentivized real economic conditions.

Moonriver is also a community-led parachain, how’s that for decentralization?

If you want to try the chain out, check the following bridges:

[**Solarbeam Bridge**](https://app.solarbeam.io/bridge) (you’ll all receive some **$MOVR** so you can transact on the chain)

[**Anyswap**](https://anyswap.exchange/) (you can send **$BIFI** and **$MIM**)

If you bridge your **$BIFI** vía Anyswap to Moonriver, you can utilize it to earn revenue from the platform as **$MOVR** tokens. To do this, stake your **$BIFI** into the BIFI Earn pool to receive **$MOVR** at around 100% APR (at the time of writing).

If you are having trouble, head over to our Discord server to find all the info you will need in the pinned messages of #-moonriver

### Deployed vaults

The first vaults we are offering are from Solarbeam AMM. We will add more vaults in the future, so if you don’t want to miss out, follow @beefyfinance on Twitter. We have deployed vaults for all types of investors, blue chips, stablecoins, and even degen. If you want your favorite Moonriver platform added to Beefy, head over to our Discord and talk with the team.
