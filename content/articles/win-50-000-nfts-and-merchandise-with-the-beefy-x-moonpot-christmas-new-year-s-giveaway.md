### Win $50,000, NFTs, and merchandise with the Beefy x Moonpot Christmas & New Year’s Giveaway

What would the holidays be without a few DeFi presents under the Christmas tree? This year, you won’t even have to put up with a cheesy Christmas jumper either… To celebrate Christmas 2021 and New Year’s, Beefy Finance and Moonpot have teamed up to give you the chance of winning $50,000, NFTs, and some awesome merchandise. Get yourself in the Christmas spirit with both teams and celebrate a bumper year of APY, gains, and prizes.

### What exactly is the competition?

Three new Moonpots will open from 24 to 31 December 2021, each with different holiday prizes. This adds up to a total of 9 draws with 210 winners. To participate in each Pot you will need either:

**mooBIFI** - The receipt of BIFI deposited on [the BIFI Maxi vault](https://app.beefy.finance/#/bsc/vault/bifi-maxi) on Binance Smart Chain. The maximum deposit amount accepted in the mooBIFI Pot will be 0.1 mooBIFI (around 0.11 BIFI)

**POTS** - Moonpot’s governance and reward token, with a maximum of 50 $POTS

**mooChristmasBeefy** - Last Christmas, Beefy's BSC’s BIFI Maxi vault distributed mooChristmasBeefy to stakers. If you don’t hold these tokens, you can still participate in the other two Pots!

### Christmas NFTs powered by Galaxy

When it comes to NFTs, Galaxy is helping revolutionize the space. Projects can easily create lines of NFTs with a huge amount of flexibility. Galaxy NFTs aren't just collectibles either, they can also act as a form of digital identification. Because of these factors, we chose to partner with Galaxy to bring you our funky merchandise NFTs. Each one will be available to claim on Galaxy at [https://galaxy.eco/beefy](https://galaxy.eco/beefy "https://galaxy.eco/beefy") and convert into merch.

### How do I collect my merchandise if I win?

If you win a hoodie or T-shirt in one of the Moonpot draws, your wallet will be credited with a merchandise NFT. Claim the NFT at Galaxy.eco which will then let you order your prize. Make sure you burn your NFT before February or you will lose your right to the merchandise.
