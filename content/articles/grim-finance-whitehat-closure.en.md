The 24th of February we started executing the Redistribution of rescued funds. In order to do this we took a series of snapshots of the blocks prior to the whitehack transactions. The approach we took to airdrop the tokens to their rightful owners is comparing the value of the deposits at the moment of the whitehack, and the current value of these tokens, and took the highest. Beefy added USDC to the airdrop to compensate for those deposits that lost value. This was done to make sure the whitehack operation didnâ€™t yield a negative impact on any depositor. No native tokens were sold in order to execute the airdrop.

We tried to be as transparent as possible through the whole process, so we think it's best that you can check all the calculations that we used, and the transactions that we made in this doc: link

Beefy is committed to build a decentralized, multichain, trustless, and secure future. At that moment we felt that performing this whitehat operation was the best for the space. In retrospect we realize that we miss handled the situation. Because of this reason we did this redistribution in the fairest and quickest way possible.

This attempt at protecting users of another project led us to spend 100,000 FTM from our own treasury and countless hours to design, execute, and document our actions. As a closing word we want to say that we learned a valuable lesson and will not perform this kind of operation in the future.
