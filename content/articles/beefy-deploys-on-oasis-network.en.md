We’re back again to cure your hunger for chunky APY gains on the most innovative networks. This time, we’ve selected Emerald ParaTime as our target for some serious yield compounding. The Oasis Network is finally getting the Beefy treatment, so make sure you’re ready to take advantage of this new earning opportunity.

### What is the Oasis Network?

The Oasis Network is a decentralized, layer 1 blockchain that focuses on scalability, versatility, and privacy. The network is composed of two main elements: its ParaTime Layer and Consensus Layer.

The Consensus Layer utilizes a set of decentralized validator nodes to manage a safe, Proof of Stake consensus mechanism with the potential for high throughput. The ParaTime Layer hosts parallel chains (ParaTimes) with their own computing environment and shared state.

The key to accessing Oasis Network is its utility token ROSE. By holding ROSE, you can make network transactions and take part in staking and delegation.

### What is Emerald ParaTime?

Emerald ParaTime is an EVM-compatible ParaTime that allows for smart contract creation. It operates as the official EVM compatible ParaTime for Oasis network, with extremely low fees, scalable capability, and easy DApp integration.

### Compound APY through Yuzuswap farms and pools

To start our Oasis Network deployment, we’ve chosen to autocompound on Yuzuswap. [Yuzuswap](https://app.yuzu-swap.com/#/) is the first DEX built on Oasis and offers a Uniswap-style experience. This makes it a great opportunity for Beefy to do what it does best: maximize your Oasis Network yield. Our Yuzuswap Vaults could also lead to a BIFI-ROSE pair from the partnership.

### How does supporting Oasis Network help BIFI holders?

The Cowmoonity should never forget there will only ever be 80,000 BIFI in existence. Holding the token gives you a share of the platform revenue and supporting another chain provided more shared revenue. This mechanism also puts buying pressure on BIFI, and what BIFI holder wouldn’t like that?.
