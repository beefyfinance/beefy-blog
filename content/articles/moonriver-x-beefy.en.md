The lunar tidal influence on rivers is undeniable. Now the cows are gathering to drink from those overflown rivers.

Beefy Finance continues believing in the multi-chain future and Moonriver becomes the 9th chain we deploy on. In this blog we will tell you a bit about this parachain, how you can reach it, and which vaults we deployed, so keep reading!

### About Moonriver

Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama network that launched in June 2021. It is a sister network of Moonbeam and provides an enviorement to test in incentivized real economic conditions.

Also Moonriver is a community lead parachain, isn't it inspiring?

If you are looking into trying the chain you should check out the following bridges:

[Solarbeam Bridge](https://app.solarbeam.io/bridge) (It also sends you a bit of MOVR so you can transact on the chain)

[Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/) (have in mind you can only send MIM)

If you are still having trouble you can head over to our Discord server, and find all the info you need in the pinned messages of #-moonriver

### Deployed vaults

The first vaults that we are offering are from Solarbeam AMM. We will add more vaults in the future so if you don't wanna miss any, follow @beefyfinance in Twitter. We deployed vaults for all type of investors, blue chips, stablecoins, and even some degen. If you want your favourite Moonriver platform added to Beefy, head over to our Discord and talk with the team.
