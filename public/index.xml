      <description>About BeethovenX BeethovenX is a one-stop decentralized investment platform on Fantom Opera.
They leverage best in breed DeFi protocols to offer novel decentralized investment strategies. Built on Balancer V2, BeethovenX is the first next-generation AMM protocol on Fantom. BeethovenX builds on the strong foundation the Balancer team has laid by creating an automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor. It turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities.</description>
