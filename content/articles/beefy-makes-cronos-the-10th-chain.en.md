Beefy.Finance has recently deployed on the newly-launched Cronos blockchain to offer the safest and most reliable auto-compounding platform for DeFi users.

With the launch of Cronos, another giant joins the DeFi space, and they are doing it big. In less than one week, Cronos secured more than 500 million USD in total value locked (TVL) on their chain, and the number seems to only go up from there. There might be many reasons for this success. It could be the extremely nice APYs that VVS (a popular AMM on Cronos) offers, it could be that it is seamlessly integrated with Crypto.com, it could be that people trust in the endorsement Crypto.com offers. Or it could be all of those!

### About Cronos

Cronos is the first Cosmos EVM chain for DeFi, NFTs and Metaverse. It aims to massively scale the DeFi and decentralised application ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to instantly port apps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. With low cost, high throughput, fast finality, and built-in interoperability, Cronos is poised to bring decentralised applications to the 10M+ user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem and beyond.

### Beefy Vaults

The cow never sleeps, this is why our team has been looking at VVS smart contracts to create the vaults that auto-compound VVS rewards into more of the token you deposited.  
Can you see these amazing opportunities that we can do with our deployment on Cronos?

### How to reach Cronos

This might not come as a surprise. The best way to get money into Cronos (and into these vaults) is through theCrypto.com app and exchange. All you need to do is have your tokens on your Crypto.com account, and withdraw to an external wallet. You can also use the [Crypto.com DeFi Wallet](https://crypto.com/defi-wallet) or [Cronos Bridge webapp](https://cronos.crypto.org/bridge/) to bridge CRO from Crypto.org chain to Cronos using the official decentralised bridge. The process is super straightforward, and if you run into any trouble, you can head over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DRw3wCdP).

Under the #cronos channel of our Discord server, you will find a pinned message with a step-by-step tutorial guiding you to the whole process. Keep in mind that you will need a KYC account to take this approach. In that Discord channel, you will also find other alternatives, like [Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/bridge) or [Elk](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router).
